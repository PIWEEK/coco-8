# COCO-8

COCO-8 (or ðŸ‘»-8) is a fantasy VM for games and creative coding. COCO-8 runs on Wasm and it's written in Rust.

COCO-8 is [made of these parts](./docs/architecture.md):

- `coco-core`, the virtual CPU. It is basically [Uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html), as _documented_ (COCO-8 follows the documented spec, not the reference implementation of Uxn).

- Devices, which interface with the CPU and provide input / output with peripherals or other systems (e.g. video, audio, controller input, etc.).

- A web-based GUI, for users to load and run COCO-8 roms.

## Build and run

### Requirements

You need Rust and Cargo in your system. You can get them with [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

You will also need the `wasm-bindgen` CLI tool.

### Build

```zsh
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

The `build.sh` shell script builds the Rust code and generates ESM modules inside `coco-ui/vendor`.

```zsh
./build.sh
```

### Run

To run COCO-8, you just need to start a local web server in `coco-ui`.

If you have npm in your system:

```zsh
npx http-server coco-ui
```
